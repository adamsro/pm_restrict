Private Message Restrict allows limiting the number of recipients for a user/role/group to another set of users/roles/groups based on a set of rules.  An option exists to force users that match a rule to send to everyone the rule applis to. For example, a rule could exist which would force all users with only the 'authenticated user' to send to all users with role 'administration'.

If multiple restriction rules apply to an author then the last rule applied will take precedence.

Since all users have the role 'authenticated user', the 'authenticated user' role will be repurposed. The 'authenticated user' role will act to select the set of users who have no other roles aside from 'authenticated user'.
